# Logging — format, level, and per-class-type content

Single principle: **a log line is the only witness left once the debugger is gone.**
Whoever reads it later — an on-call engineer, an audit, a postmortem — reconstructs what
happened from the line alone, not from re-running the request.

## Why this is a rule and not part of `observability.md`

Both used to live in `observability.md`. Splitting them fixes an ownership overlap: this
file owns what gets written and how; `@.claude/rules/observability.md` owns which vendor
mechanism supplies the correlation identifier's value and how metrics/tracing
integration is annotated. A rule about log content that also decided the tracing
vendor's wiring was two topics wearing one name.

## `logback.xml`

Every project ships a `logback-spring.xml`, present from the first commit, in
`src/main/resources` of the module that gets packaged — **not** at the project root:
logback only resolves its config from the classpath root, and a root-level file is
never on it. One file, no per-module copy. `logback-spring.xml`, not plain
`logback.xml`, so Spring Boot's own profile-aware initialization is what loads it.
Default pattern, console appender:

```
%d{ISO8601} %-5level [traceId=%X{traceId}] %logger{36} - %msg%n
```

`traceId` is an MDC key, populated per `@.claude/rules/observability.md`'s decision on
where the value comes from — this file doesn't decide that, only that the field exists
and where it sits in the line.

No JSON encoder by default. Until the project declares a structured-logging dependency,
the pattern above is the contract; adding one means updating the dependency and this
line in the same change, not silently diverging from it.

## Format and level

- One event per line, structured, with the correlation identifier as its own field —
  never interpolated into the middle of the message.
- Level, by business meaning: `ERROR` only for what requires human action; `WARN` for
  recovered degradation or an expected business rejection; `INFO` for a business state
  transition. An expected failure translated into the client's response is `WARN` or
  `INFO`, never `ERROR`.
- The exception enters the log as an exception, with the stack, not as concatenated
  text — except where `@.claude/rules/error-handling.md` says otherwise for a typed
  business exception (no stack, `errorCode` as its own field).
- **Zero *raw* sensitive data in the log**: credentials, tokens, cards, personal
  documents. Two ways to comply, not one — pick per field: log the technical key instead
  of the value (an id, not the document it identifies), or mask the value before it's
  interpolated into the line, never the value itself unmasked. A masked field still
  counts as compliant; an unmasked one never does, regardless of how it got there.
- Logging inside the domain is a smell. The domain throws and returns; the adapter or
  application service is the one that logs, because it's the one that knows what the
  event means to the outside.

## Masking mechanism

The concrete tool for the "mask it" half of the rule above, same discipline
`@.claude/rules/lombok.md` already uses for naming a concrete annotation instead of
staying abstract: a field-level `@MaskSensitiveData` annotation (predefined patterns —
email, document, name, date, address, zip code, number, telephone — or a custom regex,
declared once per field) plus a small interface a record or DTO implements to get a
masked `toString()` for free. Lives in the project's cross-cutting `commons` package
(named per this project's own `CLAUDE.md`), alongside two logging annotations —
`@LogExecution` for a method, `@HttpMethodLogExecution` for a REST endpoint — and a
global aspect that logs every REST endpoint's parameters and response **by default**,
opt-out via configuration, not opt-in.

That default matters here specifically: a response DTO reaching a controller without
implementing the masking interface gets logged raw the moment the endpoint runs, whether
or not anyone remembered to think about it. A DTO with a PII field masks it before it
ever reaches a controller — this is the point in the pipeline where the "zero raw
sensitive data" line above stops being a promise and starts being what actually happens.

## Masking candidates — derived, never remembered

Which fields the mechanism above applies to is **not** a judgment call made once per
field. It is derived, and this section is the single owner of the derivation.

A field is a masking candidate when **either** holds:

1. Its type is one of `@.claude/rules/value-objects.md`'s catalog entries for personal
   data — `Email`, `PhoneNumber`, `Cpf`, `Cnpj`, `Document` — or the field is the
   primitive that stands in for one of them.
2. Its name matches the list below, case-insensitive, on the whole name or as a part of
   it.

| Kind | Names |
|---|---|
| National id | `cpf`, `cnpj`, `rg`, `ssn`, `taxId`, `nationalId`, `securityNumber`, `socialSecurity` |
| Generic document | `document`, `documento`, `documentNumber`, `passport`, `driverLicense` |
| Contact | `email`, `phone`, `telefone`, `celular`, `mobile`, `whatsapp` |
| Address | `address`, `endereco`, `street`, `logradouro`, `zipCode`, `cep`, `postalCode` |
| Birth | `birthDate`, `dataNascimento`, `dateOfBirth` |
| Payment | `card`, `cardNumber`, `cvv`, `cvc`, `iban`, `pix`, `accountNumber`, `agency` |
| Credential | `password`, `senha`, `secret`, `token`, `apiKey`, `accessKey`, `privateKey` |

The name list is what the type test cannot reach: a `String securityNumber` carrying a
CPF is a leak no type-based check sees, and it is exactly the field that crossed design,
implementation, review and a green build in a real project. The list trails reality by
one field, always — a field whose name is not here and whose content is personal data is
still a candidate, and whoever notices adds the name.

**The burden is inverted.** A field that matches is masked unless someone writes why it
is not. Not masking is the decision that needs a reason; masking is the default. A name
on the list that is genuinely not personal data (`accountNumber` of an internal ledger,
say) is declared as such where the field is designed, in one line, not left implicit.

Counter-list, so the derivation does not turn into masking everything: `name`,
`description`, `comments`, `title`, `status`, `type`, `id` of an aggregate, `createdAt`,
`version`, `amount`, `price`. A value that is not personal data and not a credential is
not a candidate, however long it is.

## Per class type

What each layer logs, so "log something" doesn't turn into copy-pasted judgment calls
per class. Names per `@.claude/rules/naming.md` and the active blueprint's
`packages.map`.

| Class type | What it logs | Level |
|---|---|---|
| `<Resource>Controller` (inbound REST) | method + path, response status, duration | `INFO` on success; `WARN`/`ERROR` per `error-handling.md`'s exception-family mapping on failure |
| `<Verb><Noun>UseCase` / `<Verb><Noun>Service` (inbound port + its implementation) | one line per business state transition (`from → to`, not the full payload) | `INFO` |
| `<Resource>RepositoryAdapter` (outbound persistence) | query identifier, duration | `WARN` when the duration crosses `@.claude/rules/persistence.md`'s slow-query threshold, otherwise not logged |
| domain (aggregate, value object, domain service) | nothing | — always a smell, see § Format and level |
| outbound integration adapter (external HTTP/gateway client) | outcome (success/failure) and latency, never the raw request/response payload | `INFO` on success, `WARN` on a failure the caller recovers from |
| inbound event/message listener | event or message type, correlation identifier, outcome | `INFO` |

The inbound port (`UseCase`) is an interface — the log line physically lives in the
implementing `Service`, since interfaces have no method body. Listed together because
they're one decision (what this use case logs at its own boundary), not two.

## Admitted exception

A service without an inbound adapter — message processor, scheduled task — has no HTTP
response to attach the identifier to, but the general log rule above still applies:
one line per business transition, correlation identifier as its own field, using the
message's or the execution's identifier in place of the response's. Where that
identifier comes from is `observability.md`'s decision, not this file's.

## How to verify

§ Masking candidates is checked by an architecture test: a DTO in the inbound REST
adapter's DTO package with a field matching the derivation implements the masking
interface and marks the field. The test is guarded by the presence of that interface —
where the `commons` package was never installed there is nothing to implement, and the
rule evaluates vacuously instead of failing.

The rest of this file has no mechanical check: the format, the levels and the per-class
content are `Review`-verified, same class as `naming.md` and `value-objects.md`. The one
other structurally checkable part — no `org.slf4j.Logger` field in the domain package —
is not enforced yet.
