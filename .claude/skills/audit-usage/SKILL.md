## Consolidated trail

!`java "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.claude/hooks/ArchHook.java" audit summary 2>&1`

---

Everything below reads. This skill never writes into `.claude/audit-usage/` and never
edits project code — the trail is written by `ArchHook.java audit`, at `Stop`, and by
nothing else.

Answer in English, the language of the reports themselves, so the consolidated view and
the per-run report read as one document. Reports and ledger rows written by an older
hook are in Portuguese (`✅ sucesso`, `USD 1,23`); quote them as they are, never translate
a number or a status out of them.

## When the block came back empty

The trail is off: `.claude/audit-usage/` does not exist, and `audit summary` prints
nothing at all. That is the switch, not a failure. Say so, and give the two commands that
turn it on — creating the directory is enough, the hook is already wired in
`.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/audit-usage
printf '.claude/audit-usage/.state/\n' >> .gitignore
```

Then stop. Do not create the directory yourself: switching a versioned audit trail on is
the user's decision, not a side effect of asking what it holds.

If the block says `closed runs: 0`, no run has **finished** yet. Any report listed
under `⏳ No ledger line` is from a run in progress — report it as such and say the
ledger line is written only when the run closes.

## What the block already did

`ArchHook.java audit summary` reads `history.jsonl` (one line per top-level run) and
`nodes.jsonl` (one line per skill or agent that run chained) and does the arithmetic:
totals, spend per piece without double counting, failure rate, and the reports worth
opening. The aggregation is Java on purpose — the ledgers grow without bound, and
injecting them raw would cost tokens on every read and leave the sums to you.

**Never recompute a number the block printed, and never read the `.jsonl` files to
re-derive one.** Your job is rendering and judgment, not arithmetic.

What the block's vocabulary means:

- **Piece** — a skill (`📘`) or an agent (`🤖`) of this project. Plugin skills and runtime
  agents are not recorded.
- **Origin** — `user` typed `/<skill>`; `model` invoked the piece on its own, with no
  run open.
- **Model** — the model the run billed on, or a comma-separated list when a subagent ran
  on another one. `—` means the run was recorded before the column existed, not that the
  model is unknown. It is the first thing to read before comparing two runs of the same
  pipeline: the same skills over the same use case cost tenfold more on a larger model,
  and that difference is not a regression of the pipeline.
- **root · nested · preloaded** — the piece opened its own run; it was chained
  inside another run; or it was loaded through an agent's `skills:` frontmatter (no
  tokens of its own — they are its agent's).
- **own tokens** — a piece's own spend. A run's total minus its chained pieces is
  the root's own; that is why the per-piece bars add up to the totals instead of
  exceeding them.
- **`*` after a cost** — partial sum: some invocations had no price configured.
- **Calls** — tool calls counted from the transcripts' `tool_use` blocks, attributed to
  pieces like the tokens. `—` means the run was recorded before the column existed.
- **Peak** — the largest single request a piece sent (input + cache read + cache write):
  how much context one turn carried. An absolute number: never turn it into a percentage
  of a context window you would have to state from memory.
- **Plan windows** — how many runs of a piece fit a plan's 5-hour and weekly windows, as
  if nothing else ran: the Pro budget in `.claude/audit-usage/plan-limits.json` × the plan's
  multiplier ÷ the piece's mean cost, capped by the window's hours ÷ its mean active duration.
  `budget` or `time` says which limit binds. Max 5x and 20x are multiples of Pro on 5 hours,
  the only multiplier Anthropic publishes; Max weekly has no column. A root row counts the
  whole run, what typing that command costs; a `(chained, own)` row only that piece's share.

## Procedure

### 1 · Route on the argument

| Argument | Do this |
|---|---|
| empty | § 2 — consolidated view |
| `last` / `último` | § 3 for the `most recent` report the block names |
| a skill or agent name (`new-feature`, `java-spring-boot-developer`, …) | § 2 reduced to that piece's line, then § 3 for its newest report: `ls -1t .claude/audit-usage/*--<name>.md` when it ran as a root; otherwise the newest `run` of its line in `grep '"skill":"<name>"' .claude/audit-usage/nodes.jsonl` — a chained piece's report is its parent's |
| any other text | treat it as a fragment of a report filename (`ls -1t .claude/audit-usage`); § 3 for the single match. Two or more matches: list them and ask which |

### 2 · Consolidated view

Present the block, in its order, keeping its tables and the `text` bar chart intact —
bars are proportional to billable tokens, not to duration, which is wall-clock and
includes time the user spent thinking. Then add what the block can't:

1. **One line of reading** above the tables — where the money went, in words.
2. **Where it went** — from the `Where the pieces spent` block, the piece whose calls
   are dominated by one tool, or whose peak stands out from the rest. Name the tool and
   the number; that is what points at the step to trim.
3. **Health** — name the piece with the worst failure ratio. A piece that fails
   repeatedly is a bad spec, not bad luck.
4. **What to read next** — the single most relevant report, and the exact
   `/audit-usage <fragment>` that opens it.

If the block says `cost: not configured`, say so and point at
`.claude/audit-usage/pricing.json` — never fill the gap with a price.
If the plan windows say `not configured`, say so and point at
`.claude/audit-usage/plan-limits.json` — `{"pro": {"five_hour_usd": <n>, "weekly_usd": <n>}}`, the USD
the person saw a Pro window hold (the audit's cost when `/usage` reached 100%). Never suggest a
budget: Anthropic publishes none, and one written from memory looks as authoritative as a
measured one.

### 3 · Single run

`Read` the `.md` file. It is already a finished, icon-rich report — **do not re-render
it and do not paste it back in full.** Summarize in at most six lines: what was run, the
outcome, what it cost, the longest step, where it spent (from `🔎 Where the run spent`:
the dominant tool, the costliest turn, the peak context), and anything that deserves
attention (`⏳ in progress`, compaction incidents, permissions added, repeated tool
failures — quote the error's first line the report already redacted, never more).
Then give the path so the user can open the whole thing.

Point out `⏳ in progress` when you see it: it means the run never closed — the session
was killed, or it is still open right now.

## What this skill will not do

- **Never edits or deletes anything under `.claude/audit-usage/`.** Pruning old reports
  is the user's call; if they ask, show the command and let them run it.
- **Never recomputes a cost from memory.** The numbers come from `audit summary`, which
  prices from `pricing.json`. If prices are `null`, the honest answer is "cost not configured" plus
  the path to fill in — never an invented rate. A price written from memory is wrong the
  day after it changes, and it looks exactly as authoritative as a correct one.
- **Never reads `.state/`.** Those are the hook's open append-only logs; the rendered
  `.md` is the readable form.
- **Never quotes a redacted value.** The reports blank credential-shaped text on the way
  in. If something still looks like a live secret in a report, say so and point at
  `.claude/schemas/extensions.json`'s `audit.redact` block — a pattern is missing there.

## Why this is a skill, and why the hook ignores it

The hook already answers "what happened in **this** run", and `audit summary` does the
sums across runs. Nothing turns that into "which piece is eating the budget, and which
report should I open" — judgment over data, routed by an argument, which is a procedure,
not a norm and not enforcement.

`audit-usage` is one of the skills the trail does **not** record — the observers: its
class, `observer` in `skill_classes` of `.claude/schemas/extensions.json`, declares
`audited: false`, and `arch-doctor` sits in the same class. Without that, reading the trail would append a report about reading the
trail, and every later read would be mostly reads.

Invoking it still **closes** whatever run is open, and that is the useful half: within a
single session a report stays stamped `⏳ in progress` until something ends the run, so
asking for the report is what finalizes it.

`arch-adopt` is never recorded either — fixed in its own class override. Any other piece
can be switched per project in `.claude/audit-usage/audited.json` (`{"skills": {"<name>":
false}, "agents": {}}`), the one file of `.claude/` the project owns and `/arch-adopt` never
overwrites; `doctor`'s `Audit overrides` line validates it.

Runs on `sonnet` with `effort: low`: `audit summary` already did the sums, and what is
left is ranking and rendering.

## Contract

- **Class:** observer — the territory is `skill_classes.observer` in
  `@.claude/schemas/extensions.json`, and it is **empty**: this skill writes no file. The
  reports under `.claude/audit-usage/` are written by the `audit` hook, not by whoever reads
  them. `ArchHook.java guard` enforces it.
- **Reads** — the output of `ArchHook.java audit summary`; `.claude/audit-usage/*.md`;
  `.claude/audit-usage/nodes.jsonl` only to find the report of a chained piece
- **Writes** — nothing
- **Handoff** — none. Terminal skill: it reports and stops
