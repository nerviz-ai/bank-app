# External sources — persistence, JPA, and SQL

Reference for the `persistence-architect` skill. Each row has the source and what to go
fetch there. Official documentation first; where it diverges from any summary, the
official one wins.

**Freshness warning.** This list was assembled on 2026-09-07. URLs change and versions
ship. If a link breaks or the cited version is stale, resolve the project's actual
version (`./mvnw dependency:tree`) before applying what's written there — never write
versions from memory (`@CLAUDE.md`, invariant 8).

## Official

| Source | Go fetch |
|---|---|
| <https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/data/sql.html> | Datasource configuration, pool, schema initialization |
| <https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/reference/> | Query name derivation, `@EntityGraph`, `Pageable`, projections |
| <https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/data-access/transaction.html> | `@Transactional` semantics, propagation, isolation |
| <https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html> | Batch, fetch, cache, identifier generation |
| <https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/> | The JPA specification. Ultimate source for what's portable across engines |
| <https://documentation.red-gate.com/fd/flyway-documentation-138346877.html> | File names, checksums, `out-of-order`, transactions per migration |
| <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html> | How to read `EXPLAIN`; meaning of each node |
| <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes.html> | Index types, composite indexes, functional and partial indexes |

## Secondary reference

| Source | Go fetch | Caveat |
|---|---|---|
| <https://vladmihalcea.com/tutorials/hibernate/> | N+1 catalog, batch, id strategies, mapping cases | Single author; confirm against the official docs before fixing it as a rule |
| <https://use-the-index-luke.com/> | How a B-tree index is actually used; column order | Engine-agnostic; specific syntax comes from the engine's docs |
| <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing> | Why a bigger pool usually worsens latency | Heuristic, not formula |
| <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ParallelChange.html> | Expand/contract — the pattern behind three-step migrations | Conceptual |

## What these sources don't decide

Names, aggregate boundaries, and what counts as a value object aren't resolved here:
they're `@.claude/rules/naming.md`, `@.claude/rules/architecture-ddd.md`, and
`@.claude/rules/value-objects.md`. An article that contradicts a rule of this repository
doesn't win by being external — if the rule is wrong, the rule gets changed, with a
record.
