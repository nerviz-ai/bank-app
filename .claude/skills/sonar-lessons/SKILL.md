# Sonar Lessons

Turns one SonarQube analysis into a lesson the **meta-repository** can act on. A Sonar
issue in a generated project is almost never a one-off: the code came from a template, a
norm allowed it, or nothing in `.claude/` said anything and the model decided alone. Fixing
it here fixes one project; fixing the owner fixes every project generated afterwards. This
skill finds the owner and writes it down; `/report-issue`, typed by the user, hands it to the
repository that owns it.

**Entry rule: this skill runs the analysis, it never sets it up.** No scanner in the root
build file, no server answering, no token — stop and say which one, and what fixes it. It
writes nothing outside `docs/lessons-learned/`: not the build file, not the compose file,
not the token.

**The local file is complete; the issue is not this skill's.** Project paths, lines and
excerpts all belong in `sonar-NNN.md`. What may leave the project — and the privacy rule that
decides it — is owned by `/report-issue`.

## Why this is a skill (Form 2) and not an agent

Form 2 because a full `verify` plus analysis is a side effect the model must not trigger on
its own — axis 2 of the design interview: the user types `/sonar-lessons`, nothing chains
it. Publishing the issue was the second such effect until `0103` moved it to `/report-issue`,
the one door from a generated project to the meta-repository. The symptom behind it (axis 1) was the same
long prompt pasted into every feature round to produce a Sonar lessons-learned by hand. The
closest rejected form was the same skill plus a `sonnet` collector agent holding the build
log and raw JSON; it failed the counter-test of invariant 5, since `facets` and small pages
already keep the extraction short. Record:

Runs on `opus`: step 4 — deciding which norm or template owns a finding, and what the fix
at the owner is — is the judgment the hand-written lessons-learned needed.

## Procedure

Endpoints, parameters and response fields of every call below:
`references/sonar-web-api.md`. Every `curl` authenticates with `-u "$SONAR_TOKEN:"` and
never prints the variable.

### 1 · Preconditions — stop on the first that fails

1. Root build file: `pom.xml` → maven, `build.gradle` → gradle. Neither → stop: nothing to
   analyze (this is also what happens when the skill is typed in the Nerviz
   repository itself).
2. Scanner declared — `sonar-maven-plugin` / `org.sonarqube` in that file. Absent → stop:
   "run `/sonarqube-setup` first".
3. `sonar.host.url` and `sonar.projectKey` read from the build file (`sonar.organization`
   too, for SonarCloud).
4. `curl -sS <host>/api/system/status` answers `"status":"UP"`. Connection refused on
   `localhost` → stop: "`docker compose up -d sonarqube`, wait for `UP`, re-run". Any other
   host → stop, naming the host.
5. `SONAR_TOKEN` set and valid — `curl -sS -u "$SONAR_TOKEN:" <host>/api/authentication/validate`
   answers `"valid":true`. Unset or invalid → stop, naming the variable.
6. Browse permission — one `component_tree` read with `ps=1`, the call step 3's duplication
   read makes (`references/sonar-web-api.md` § Preconditions). `403` → stop with the
   project-analysis-token message below, before step 2 spends minutes on an analysis
   nothing can read. `404` → the project has never been analyzed: go on, and the first
   read of step 3 proves Browse instead, stopping the same way on a `403`.

### 2 · Run the analysis

| Tool | Command |
|---|---|
| maven | `./mvnw -B -q verify sonar:sonar` |
| gradle | `./gradlew -q build sonar` |

`-q` rather than a redirect to a log file: the output stays short, and a redirect is a
write outside this skill's territory. A red build stops here — report the failing module
and the first error line; a lessons-learned about an analysis that never ran is fiction.

The analysis is **asynchronous**. Read `ceTaskId` from `target/sonar/report-task.txt`
(`build/sonar/report-task.txt` for gradle) and poll `/api/ce/task?id=<ceTaskId>` until
`SUCCESS`. Reading measures before that returns the **previous** analysis, silently.
`FAILED` or `CANCELED` → stop with the task's `errorMessage`.

### 3 · Extract

In this order, all read-only:

1. **Quality gate** — status and every condition, with its threshold and actual value.
2. **Measures** — the list in the reference: bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, hotspots,
   coverage, duplication, ratings, `ncloc`, and the `new_*` metrics the gate reads.
3. **Issues by rule** — one call with `ps=1` and facets on rules, software qualities,
   severities and scopes: the counts, without paging through every issue. Then, for each
   rule, one call with a small `ps` for sample locations, split `MAIN` / `TEST`.
4. **Rule text** — `/api/rules/show` for each rule key: its name and why it matters.
5. **Duplication** — files with duplicated blocks, then the blocks of each.
6. **Coverage** — the files with the most uncovered lines.

Large answers are the only real cost of this skill: always request the facet first and
page only what step 4 needs.

### 4 · Trace each finding group to its owner

Group by Sonar rule (a duplicated block is its own group). For each group, find the piece
of **this project's `.claude/`** that produced it, in this order, and stop at the first hit:

| Origin | How to find it |
|---|---|
| **Template copied verbatim** | `Grep` the flagged construct in `.claude/skills/*/templates/*.example`. A hit means every project gets the issue |
| **Norm that allows or requires it** | `.claude/rules/00-index.md` → the norm for that layer; a norm that prescribes the flagged shape, or explicitly permits it |
| **Checkstyle / build configuration** | `config/checkstyle/*.xml` and the root build file — a check that is missing, or disabled, where Sonar has the equivalent rule |
| **Test template teaches the pattern** | Same as the first row, restricted to `test-architect` and `new-feature` test templates |
| **Code the bootstrap generated** | No template in the project — `project-bootstrap` does not travel. Name it `project-bootstrap` plus the role of the file (entry point, exception handler, config class) |
| **Nothing — the model decided alone** | No norm and no template covers the construct. The fix is a norm, or a line in the one that owns that layer |

Then decide the **fix at the owner**: which file in `.claude/`, what change, and whether it
also needs enforcement (a Checkstyle check, an ArchUnit rule) so the issue cannot come back.
Say it concretely — a file path, a line, the shape of the change — never "improve the
template".

Check whether an owner file was edited locally since the export:
`java .claude/hooks/ArchHook.java doctor` names the edited `.claude/` files. When the file at
fault is one of them, the lesson says so: the meta-repository's version may not have the defect.

### 5 · Write `docs/lessons-learned/sonar-NNN.md`

`NNN` is the highest existing `sonar-*.md` plus one, `001` when the directory is empty.
Fill `templates/lessons-learned.md.example`: snapshot, issues by origin, one section per
group, and the structural lesson — what in `.claude/` would have caught the whole class of
issue before the analysis did. Complete here: project paths, lines, excerpts all belong in
this file.

**Progress against the previous run.** When `sonar-<NNN-1>.md` exists, read its snapshot
and fill the snapshot's *Previous* and *Δ* columns, and mark each finding group *new*,
*recurring* (same rule key in the previous file) or — in a closing list — *gone*. The goal
is fewer issues each round; this is the only place that says whether it is happening. A
recurring group whose previous file already named the fix at the owner says so: the fix was
proposed and has not reached this project (not merged upstream, or not pulled with
`/arch-adopt`).

Report the path and the snapshot line, then go on to step 6.

### 6 · Hand it to `/report-issue` — print the command, invoke nothing

Write `not filed yet — /report-issue docs/lessons-learned/sonar-NNN.md` in the `## Issue`
line at the end of `sonar-NNN.md`, and end the report with that command. `/report-issue` is
manual-only: it picks the `sonar-lessons` form, strips the project from the body, searches
duplicates, asks, and overwrites the `## Issue` line with the outcome. The user types it, or
the lesson stays local — the line says which, for a later reader and for the next run's
step 5.

## Failure modes

**No scanner in the build file:**
```
❌ pom.xml declares no sonar-maven-plugin. Run /sonarqube-setup, then /sonar-lessons.
Nothing written.
```

**Server down:**
```
❌ http://localhost:9000 refused the connection.
Run `docker compose up -d sonarqube`, wait for /api/system/status to answer UP, re-run.
```

**Token missing, invalid, or unable to read:**
```
❌ SONAR_TOKEN is not set — export a user token (My Account → Security) and re-run.
❌ <call> answered 403 — SONAR_TOKEN can analyze but not browse this project.
   A project analysis token cannot read the Web API; use a user token with Browse.
```

**Build red:**
```
❌ verify failed in <module> — <first error line>. No analysis ran; nothing written.
```

**Compute engine task failed:**
```
❌ Analysis task <id> ended FAILED: <errorMessage>. The previous analysis is still on the
server; nothing was read from it.
```

## Report

```

## Contract

**Class:** report — the territory is `skill_classes.report` in
`@.claude/schemas/extensions.json`: `docs/lessons-learned/**`, nothing else. `ArchHook.java
guard` enforces it; `target/` and `build/`, which the analysis writes, are ignored by git
and outside what `guard sweep` sees.

**Reads** the root build file, `target/sonar/report-task.txt` (or `build/sonar/`),
`.claude/rules/**`, `.claude/skills/*/templates/**`, `config/checkstyle/**`,
`.claude/.arch-provenance.json` (the version line of the file), and the SonarQube Web API.

**Writes** `docs/lessons-learned/sonar-NNN.md`.

**Publishes** nothing. The issue is `/report-issue`'s, typed by the user with the path step 6
prints; the body file `sonar-NNN.issue.md` is written there.

**Never writes** the build file, `docker-compose.yml`, a token, or anything under `src/`. A
finding is fixed at its owner in the meta-repository, or by `/new-feature` in this
project — not by this skill.

**Not chained** by any skill. Travels into the generated project
(`export.skills.include`); in the Nerviz repository itself it stops at
step 1, which has no build file.
