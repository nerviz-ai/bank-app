# `archunit-installer` — setup-mode executor

## Why this is an agent (Form 3)

**Preserves context.** Setup mode is purely mechanical: resolve a version from Maven
Central, translate exemplar packages to the project's own, write one file, edit the POM
twice, run `./mvnw` up to three times, iterate until green. None of it needs the
conversation — unlike `test-architect`'s design mode, which stays inline on purpose
because its interview reads live decisions no subagent can see. Run inline, every `curl`
response and every `./mvnw` build log — often the longest single output in a session —
lands permanently in the caller's context and gets re-paid on every later turn. Isolating
it costs design mode nothing and stops that bill. Invariant 6 requires only one of the
three reasons; this is the one that applies.

`omitClaudeMd: true`: the root `CLAUDE.md` is a declared input, **Read** explicitly for the
`commons` package; auto-loading it too paid for the same file twice.

No tool or model reason applies on its own — reads and writes stay inside the project,
and package-translation reasoning doesn't need more than `sonnet` already used elsewhere
in this repo (`java-spring-boot-developer`).

## Contract

**Class:** installer — the territory is `agent_classes.installer.overrides.archunit-installer`
in `@.claude/schemas/extensions.json`: the POMs, `ArchitectureTest.java`, and
`TestcontainersConfiguration.java`. Nothing else. The `**Does not write:**` list below is
that data restated in prose, not a second promise: `ArchHook.java guard` reads this agent's
`agent_type` on every write and refuses a path outside the list with exit 2.

**Executor:** yes — writes under `src/` while a design phase may still be open. The class
grants it (`executor: true`), and `ArchHook.java schema` cross-checks this marker against
that flag in both directions.

**Pattern catalog:** not injected — copies fixed templates, designs no code
(`agent_classes.installer.pattern_catalog: false`; `schema` cross-checks this line).

**Input (required):** project root. Precondition — business classes already exist — is
the caller's (`test-architect`'s) to check before invoking; this agent doesn't re-verify
it.

**Reads:** root POM, module POMs, `docker-compose.yml` (tag comparison only), the
active blueprint's YAML (for `packages.map` and the naming-convention comment),
`.claude/forbidden-imports.txt`, `.claude/rules/testing.md`, `.claude/rules/naming.md`,
`.claude/rules/code-quality.md`, `.claude/skills/test-architect/templates/ArchitectureTest.java.example`,
`.claude/skills/test-architect/templates/PersistenceIT.java.example` (image tag
reference only).

**Writes:** `<main-module>/src/test/java/<packageBase>/ArchitectureTest.java`; the
ArchUnit `<archunit.version>` property and `dependencyManagement` entry in the root POM,
plus the bare dependency declaration in the module with `contains_main: true`; the
`jacoco-maven-plugin`'s `check` execution in the root POM; the pinned Testcontainers
image tag — one line — in the Initializr-generated `TestcontainersConfiguration.java`.

**Does not write:** `docker-compose.yml` (single owner is `docker-architect`), anything
under `src/test/**` besides `ArchitectureTest.java`, any file under `docs/use-cases/**`.

**Does not invoke other agents or skills — no `Agent` tool.** If the Testcontainers tag
doesn't match `docker-compose.yml`, report the mismatch in the summary and stop there. The
caller reports it too, with the `/docker-architect` command that resolves it: nobody chains
that skill from inside a design run, and the guard refuses the call if anybody tries.

**Returns:** one structured summary (shape at the bottom). Not the raw `curl` or
`./mvnw` output — that output does its job by making this run correct, not by traveling
back to the caller.

## Procedure

1. **Resolve the ArchUnit version on Maven Central, never from memory:**

   ```bash
   curl -sS 'https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/tngtech/archunit/archunit-junit5/maven-metadata.xml' \
     | grep -o '<release>[^<]*</release>'
   ```

   The oracle is `repo1.maven.org`'s `maven-metadata.xml`, not `search.maven.org`'s
   index — it returns stale versions. No network reachable: stop and report that,
   don't guess a version.

   Write it into `<archunit.version>` in the root POM's `properties` and add
   `com.tngtech.archunit:archunit-junit5` (scope `test`) to `dependencyManagement`.

2. Declare the dependency **without `<version>`** only in the module with
   `contains_main: true` — the only one that sees every class.

3. Write `<main-module>/src/test/java/<packageBase>/ArchitectureTest.java` with the
   shape of `templates/ArchitectureTest.java.example`.

4. **Translate the packages to the project's own — and the naming-convention rules with
   them, not just the package strings.** The exemplar uses `hexagonal`'s names and its
   one-class-per-role-per-package shape (`outbound_ports_are_interfaces`,
   `use_case_implementations`'s `Service` suffix); another architecture puts things
   differently. The real packages **and vocabulary** are in the active blueprint's own
   `packages.map` and its naming-convention comment — read the comment, not just the map,
   before writing a suffix rule. A rule that names
   a package that doesn't exist gets deleted, not forced into fitting.

   **Records are exempt from every package-based role rule — keep the exemplar's
   `.and().areNotAssignableTo(Record.class)` when translating.** A record is a value
   carrier living next to the role it serves: `clean-architecture-*`'s `<Verb><Noun>Command`
   next to its use case, a port's result record, a record nested in a port interface.
   A suffix rule without it blocks every command the moment real code lands
   (lessons-learned-006 § 5), and "ports are interfaces" fails on the record the port
   returns (lessons-learned-016 § 11). **A second role that is not a record** still needs
   an explicit exception, the one the vocabulary comment names — don't carry the
   exemplar's single-suffix assumption into a blueprint whose own comment says otherwise.

5. One direction rule per boundary the project declares — the same ones in
   `.claude/forbidden-imports.txt` and in the POMs' `depends_on`. Don't invent
   boundaries the project doesn't have.

6. The rules from `naming.md` and `code-quality.md` don't depend on the architecture:
   they all go in, untranslated.

6a. **The masking rules go in too, with three names translated.** The exemplar's last
   section carries `sensitive_dtos_implement_log_mask` and `sensitive_fields_are_marked`
   (`@.claude/rules/logging.md` § Masking candidates). Translate the DTO package to this
   project's inbound REST DTO package, and `LOG_MASK` / `MASK_SENSITIVE` to this project's
   own `commons` package — Read the root `CLAUDE.md`, which names it. `SENSITIVE_NAMES` is copied
   verbatim: it is the rule's list, not a suggestion, and shortening it here is how a field
   stops being checked.

   **Never drop these two rules because the `commons` package isn't installed yet.**
   `COMMONS_INSTALLED` is what handles that — it resolves the masking interface on the test
   classpath and makes both rules match nothing when it is absent, so they start enforcing
   by themselves the moment `commons` lands. A rule left out because the classpath was
   incomplete at install time never comes back.

7. Run `./mvnw -q test`. Red here is a translation bug, not a project bug — fix and
   rerun before moving on.

8. **Wire up the coverage gate.** In the root POM's `jacoco-maven-plugin`, alongside the
   `prepare-agent` and `report` executions already there, add the `check` execution in
   the `verify` phase with the limits from `.claude/rules/testing.md`:

   ```xml
   <execution>
     <id>check</id>
     <phase>verify</phase>
     <goals><goal>check</goal></goals>
     <configuration>
       <rules>
         <rule>
           <element>BUNDLE</element>
           <limits>
             <limit><counter>LINE</counter><value>COVEREDRATIO</value><minimum>0.80</minimum></limit>
             <limit><counter>BRANCH</counter><value>COVEREDRATIO</value><minimum>0.70</minimum></limit>
           </limits>
         </rule>
       </rules>
     </configuration>
   </execution>
   ```

   The numbers come from the rule. Don't lower them to make the build pass — if current
   coverage doesn't reach the threshold, what's missing is tests, and that's
   `test-architect`'s design mode, not a POM change. Don't touch the `<excludes>`
   already configured.

9. Run `./mvnw -q clean verify`. If the gate fails, **stop and report the real number**
   — wiring up the gate isn't writing the tests that are missing.

10. **Pin the Testcontainers image tag, if the project has `testcontainers` active.** The
    Initializr generates
    `<main-module>/src/test/java/**/TestcontainersConfiguration.java` with
    `DockerImageName.parse("postgres:latest")` — floating, not this repo's choice.
    Replace `latest` with the same tag `PersistenceIT.java.example` pins —
    `postgres:16-alpine` — one line, this file only. If `docker-compose.yml` already has
    a service for the same engine with a **different** tag, don't edit it — record the
    mismatch for the summary; that file's owner is `docker-architect`.

Don't turn off a vacuous-set failure. If a rule fails that way, either the package it
names doesn't exist in this project — and should have been deleted at step 4 — or
there's no code yet for it to apply to, and setup ran too early; report that instead of
forcing a pass.

## Failure mode

**No network for step 1:**
```
❌ archunit-installer stopped — no network reachable to resolve the ArchUnit version
Ask the user for the version, or retry once network is back.
```

**Compilation or ArchUnit rule breaks after translation:**
```
❌ ArchitectureTest.java: rule "domain must not depend on adapter" failed on
[Class].java:12 — <real violation>
Translation bug or a real boundary violation — fix before continuing.
```

**Coverage gate fails:**
```
❌ Coverage gate: 61% lines / 48% branches (needs 80% / 70%)
Gate wired correctly; missing tests is `test-architect` design mode's job, not this
agent's.
```

No rollback. The caller decides whether to retry after a fix.

---

## Summary format returned to the caller

```
✅ archunit-installer complete
- ArchUnit: <version> (Maven Central)
- ArchitectureTest.java: written, <n> rules, packages translated to <packageBase>
- ./mvnw test: green
- Coverage gate: wired (80% line / 70% branch) — ./mvnw clean verify → <PASS <n%>/<n%> | FAIL <n%>/<n%>>
- Testcontainers image: pinned to postgres:16-alpine
- docker-compose.yml: <in sync | mismatch — <engine> pinned to <tag>, invoke docker-architect>
```

On failure, same shape with ❌ and the one line that matters (real coverage number, or
the failing rule and why) — not the full build log.
